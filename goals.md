# Primary Goals
- [ ] Keep track of upcoming tasks
  - Tasks must have:
    - [ ] Title
    - [ ] Due Date
    - [ ] Start Date
    - [ ] Notes (with full HTML support, like Outlook tasks)
    - [ ] Priority
    - [ ] Time estimate
    - [ ] Assignee?
- [ ] Display multiple calendars in a single, weekly view
  - Calendar should look like Outlook view, where previous days are grayed out, and current day has a line indicating the current time.
- [ ] Automatically place tasks on the calendar next to current events
  - Base this on due date, start date, time estimate, and Priority
  - [ ] Allow tasks to be split up into smaller segments (on for 30 min splits by default)
  - [ ] Have button (or automatically do this) to reschedule all unfinished tasks
- [ ] For urgent+important events, add to calendar as Busy
- [ ] Log time spent on each task and event
  - [ ] When marking an item complete, ask how much time to log, defaulting to that task's time estimate
  - [ ] 
  - Ideally this will be in the same calendar view as the main view

# Stretch Goals

  - [ ] Due Date: any valid date format, any valid day name or abbreviation (Friday, Mon), any relative reference (in 3 days, tomorrow, )
    - [ ] Optionally the user can add the word "Due" in front of the date. Required if Start Date is also included.
